What are your passions outside of work? 
I really enjoy Meetupâ€™s in the Des Moines area.  I have a lot of fun volunteering as a youth minster at St. Francis in West Des Moines. I read a lot of personal development articles I find on LinkedIn. I love love love Pinterest and spending time with my dogs Millie and Ollie.
